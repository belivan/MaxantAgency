# ============================================================================
# Work Queue System Configuration
# ============================================================================
# The UI now uses a queue-based polling system instead of SSE for long-running
# operations. This provides better reliability and allows job cancellation.
#
# Queue-based endpoints (NEW):
#   Analysis:    POST /api/analyze-queue     -> GET /api/analysis-status
#   Prospecting: POST /api/prospect-queue    -> GET /api/prospecting-status
#   Outreach:    POST /api/compose-queue     -> GET /api/compose-status
#   Reports:     POST /api/generate-queue    -> GET /api/report-status
#
# Legacy SSE endpoints (DEPRECATED but still available):
#   Analysis:    GET /api/analyze?prospect_ids=...
#   Prospecting: POST /api/prospect + GET /api/prospect/stream
#   Outreach:    POST /api/compose-all-variations (streaming)
#   Reports:     POST /api/generate-from-lead (synchronous)
#
# Benefits of queue-based approach:
#   - No SSE timeout issues with long-running jobs
#   - Job cancellation support for queued jobs
#   - Better resource management via concurrency limits
#   - Cross-engine coordination and visibility
#   - Unified monitoring dashboard
#
# Polling Configuration:
#   - Default poll interval: 3-5 seconds
#   - Automatic stop when jobs complete/fail
#   - Multiple job tracking support
