---

### Follow-Up Email #2 (Day 8-11, Final)

**Template:**
```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

Hi [Name],

Last email, I promise! I know you're busy.

totally understand. Feel free to reach out if things change.

in [industry/location]. Would love to connect!
```

---

### Post-Connection Message (Day 9)

that could help you get more [leads/sales/bookings]. Mind if I share?
```

**Key Points:**

No pressure though - I know DMs get buried 😅
```

- Keep it light and casual

## Phone Call Strategy (Local Businesses Only)

### When to Call

**✓ DO Call If:**
- Local business (within 50 miles)
- Phone number prominently displayed on their site
- Service-based business (restaurants, contractors, professionals)
- No response after 2-3 emails

**✗ DON'T Call If:**
- No phone number on website (shows they don't want calls)
- E-commerce or SaaS business (prefer email)
- After 5 PM or before 9 AM
- Already got a "not interested" response via email

---

### Phone Script

**Opening:**
```
"Hi, is this [Name]? This is [Your Name] from Maksant. I sent you
an email last week about [their website] - do you have 2 minutes?"
```

**If YES:**
```
"Great! I analyzed your website and found [1-2 specific things].
For example, [specific metric or observation]. This could help
you get more [leads/customers/bookings]. Would you be open to
a quick meeting to go over what I found?"
```

**If NO (They're Busy):**
```
"No problem! When would be a better time to call back? Or would
you prefer I just send you the details via email?"
```

**If NOT INTERESTED:**
```
"Totally understand. If things change down the road, feel free
to reach out. Best of luck with [their business]!"
```

**Key Points:**
- Be respectful of their time
- Reference your email (establishes credibility)
- Be specific (not vague "website problems")
- Offer value, don't push
- Take no for an answer gracefully

## Red Flags & When to Stop

### Stop Outreach If:

1. **They explicitly opt out**
   - Honor unsubscribe immediately
   - Remove from all channels
   - Don't reach out again

2. **No response after full sequence**
   - 3 emails + LinkedIn + Instagram = done
   - Don't keep emailing
   - Move on to next prospects

3. **They respond "not interested"**
   - Accept it gracefully
   - Thank them for their time
   - Don't try to convince them

4. **Your metrics are terrible**
   - <10% open rate = deliverability issue
   - <1% reply rate = messaging issue
   - High bounce rate = list quality issue
   - Pause, diagnose, fix before continuing

### Email Reputation Red Flags:

**Stop Sending Immediately If:**
- Bounce rate >5%
- Spam complaint rate >0.1%
- Sudden drop in open rates
- Emails landing in spam folder
- ISP blocks or warnings

**Actions:**
- Investigate deliverability issues
- Clean your list
- Review email content for spam triggers
- Check SPF/DKIM/DMARC setup
- Restart warmup process

## Monthly Review Checklist

**First Week of Each Month:**

1. **Calculate Last Month's Metrics:**
   - [ ] Total prospects contacted
   - [ ] Overall response rate
   - [ ] Meetings booked
   - [ ] Deals closed (if applicable)

2. **Identify What Worked:**
   - [ ] Which industries responded best?

   - [ ] Which channels drove most engagement?
   - [ ] What day/time had best open rates?

3. **Identify What Didn't Work:**
   - [ ] Which prospects never engaged?
   - [ ] Which templates got no responses?
   - [ ] Where are prospects dropping off?

4. **Adjust Strategy:**
   - [ ] Double down on what works
   - [ ] Drop or revise what doesn't

---

## Scaling Plan (Month 3+)

Once you have 2+ months of data and good metrics:

### Month 3: Incremental Scale
- Increase to **20-30 emails/week** (still manageable)
- Add second email account (different domain)
- Warm up second account (start slow)

### Month 4: Team Approach
- Delegate analysis to tool (trust AI more)
- Focus your time on customization and follow-ups
- Continue 20-30 emails/week per person

### Month 5: Process Optimization
- Create playbooks for different industries
- Standardize successful email templates
- Build FAQ for common objections
- Track ROI more carefully

### Month 6: Systematic Scale
- If metrics hold: Scale to 50 emails/week
- Add third email account if needed
- Consider hiring assistant for list building
- Implement CRM for better tracking

**Important:** Only scale if maintaining quality. Better to send 20 great emails than 100 mediocre ones.
