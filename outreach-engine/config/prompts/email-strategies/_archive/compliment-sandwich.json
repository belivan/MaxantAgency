I noticed your mobile menu is hidden on smaller screens - with 60%+ of restaurant searches happening on phones, visitors might be leaving before they can browse your menu. Mind if I share a couple more quick wins I found that could help you capture those mobile visitors?\n\nBest,\nAnton Yanovich\nMaksant\nhttps://maksant.com\n412-315-8398"
