I noticed your site doesn't list service information or price ranges, which usually means more phone time answering the same questions. Most dental practices I've worked with find that adding a simple services page with price ranges cuts phone time by 30-40% and actually increases bookings. Want me to share what's working for similar practices?\n\nBest,\nAnton Yanovich\nMaksant\nhttps://maksant.com\n412-315-8398"
