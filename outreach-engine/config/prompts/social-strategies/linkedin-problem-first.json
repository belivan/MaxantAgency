Given that 70%+ of healthcare searches happen on mobile, this could be significantly affecting new patient acquisition.\n\nI'm Anton from MaxantAgency - we specialize in healthcare digital presence. I conducted a comprehensive analysis of your site.\n\nDetailed report here: [REPORT_LINK]\n\nYou scored D grade (54/100) with critical mobile experience gaps and 18 WCAG accessibility violations. Your mobile performance is 29 points behind desktop.\n\nThought you should be aware. Happy to discuss the findings if useful.\n\nBest regards,\nAnton Yanovich\nMaxantAgency"
