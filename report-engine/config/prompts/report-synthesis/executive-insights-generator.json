Could a non-technical business owner understand this?\n2. Is every finding backed by screenshot evidence?\n3. Are impacts quantified or at least estimated?\n4. Is the 30/60/90 roadmap clear and actionable?\n5. Does this demonstrate deep expertise?\n6. Would I want to read this if I were the business owner?\n\n**Output Format:**\n- Headline (one sentence site health summary)\n- Overview (2-3 sentences business context)\n- Critical Findings (3-5 max, ranked by priority)\n- Strategic Roadmap (30/60/90 day plan)\n- ROI Statement (what improvements are worth)\n\n**Length:** Strict 500-word maximum. Every word counts.",
