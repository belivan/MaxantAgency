**Email Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I'm reaching out from Maksant, a web design studio that specializes in building fast, conversion-focused websites for businesses like [Company Name].

I noticed [specific observation about their current website or online presence — e.g., "your site could benefit from faster load times" or "you might not have a mobile-optimized presence yet"].

We work with businesses across the U.S. to create websites that:
- Load fast and rank well in search
- Convert visitors into customers
- Are delivered on time (5-31 day builds)
- Give you full ownership (no platform lock-in)

Our process is straightforward: fixed scope, weekly updates, and clean code. No jargon, no surprises.

**Recent work includes:**
- E-commerce stores with integrated checkout
- Service business websites with booking systems
- Product catalogs and landing pages

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to discuss how we could improve your online presence?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
