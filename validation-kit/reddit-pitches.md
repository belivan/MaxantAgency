# Reddit Validation Pitches

Ready-to-use Reddit posts for different communities. Each post is tailored to the subreddit's culture and rules.

## 1. r/web_design - "Built a tool that analyzes websites in 60 seconds"

**Title:** I built an AI that audits websites like a senior designer would - feedback welcome

**Post:**

Hey r/web_design,

I've been freelancing for a few years and got tired of spending 4-6 hours on initial website audits for prospects. So I built an AI-powered tool that does it in about 60 seconds.

**What it does:**
- Takes screenshots of desktop + mobile versions
- Uses GPT-4 Vision to analyze design (layout, typography, CTAs, visual hierarchy)
- Checks SEO, content quality, and mobile responsiveness
- Generates a letter grade (A-F) with specific improvement suggestions
- Creates a professional PDF report with before/after comparisons

**Example output:**
- Overall Grade: C (needs work)
- Design Score: 62/100
- Top Issues: CTA buttons lack prominence, inconsistent spacing, poor mobile navigation
- Quick Wins: 5 identified (things that could be fixed in under 2 hours)

I'm validating whether this is actually useful or if I built something nobody wants.

**Questions for you:**
1. Would you use something like this for prospecting new clients?
2. What would you pay for automated audits (if anything)?
3. What am I missing that would make this actually valuable?

I can share a sample report if anyone's interested. Not trying to sell anything—genuinely want feedback from people who actually do this work.

**How to share (in comments):**
- "Happy to DM a sample report if anyone wants to see the quality"
- "I analyzed my own portfolio site - here's what it found: [link to imgur screenshot]"
- Don't post direct links in the main post (often gets flagged as self-promotion)

## 2. r/entrepreneur - "Validating a B2B lead gen idea"

**Title:** Spent 6 months building a lead gen tool - now need to prove people will actually pay for it

**Post:**

**The Problem I'm Trying to Solve:**

Small agencies and freelancers waste 10-20 hours a week on:
- Finding prospects with outdated websites
- Manually auditing those websites
- Writing personalized cold emails
- Following up

**What I Built:**

An automated pipeline that:
1. Finds companies in your target industry/location (via Google Maps, etc.)
2. Analyzes their websites with AI (design, SEO, mobile, content)
3. Generates professional audit reports in 3 minutes
4. Writes personalized outreach emails based on actual issues found
5. Tracks everything in one dashboard

**Example workflow:**
- Input: "Find 50 Italian restaurants in Philadelphia with websites scoring below B"
- Output: 50 prospects with contact info, audit reports, and ready-to-send emails
- Time: About 15 minutes
- Cost: ~$6 in API fees

**My Validation Plan:**

I have a friend who's going to send 50 of these reports to small businesses to see if they respond. But I want to validate from multiple angles:

1. Would agencies pay $99-299/month for this?
2. Or is it better as a done-for-you service ($497 for 100 leads)?
3. Should I white-label it for other agencies?
4. Am I solving a problem that doesn't exist?

**What I Need:**

Honest feedback from people who've actually sold to small businesses:
- Is this valuable or a solution looking for a problem?
- What would you pay (if anything)?
- What's missing that would make you actually use it?

Not trying to sell to anyone here - genuinely trying to figure out if I should keep building this or pivot.

**Comment Response Templates:**
- "The biggest pain point is [X] - how does your tool handle that?"
  → "Great question - [explain feature]. Would that solve it for you?"

- "I'd never pay for that"
  → "Appreciate the honesty - what would make it worth paying for?"

- "Sounds interesting, can I try it?"
  → "DMing you - I can run a test campaign for you"

## 3. r/SaaS - "Pre-launch validation strategy"

**Title:** [Feedback] Built a lead gen SaaS - how do I validate before launching?

**Post:**

**Background:**

Built a B2B SaaS that automates website prospecting + analysis + outreach. Think: Apollo.io meets Ahrefs Site Audit, but focused on web design/SEO agencies finding clients.

**Core features:**
- AI-powered website analysis (6 dimensions: design, SEO, content, mobile, etc.)
- Automated prospect discovery (Google Maps, Yelp, search)
- Professional report generation (PDF/HTML)
- Personalized email composition (based on actual site issues)
- Campaign scheduling and tracking

**The Stack:**
- Microservices architecture (Node.js + Express)
- Next.js 14 frontend
- Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, xAI Grok
- Playwright for screenshots

**Current State:**
- All features working in production
- Cost per lead: ~$0.10-0.12 (API fees)
- 0 paying customers (haven't launched yet)

**My Question:**

I'm planning to validate with:
1. Free audit lead magnet (give away reports, upsell consulting)
2. Reddit/Twitter posts (gauge interest)
3. Cold outreach to 10 agencies (partnership pilots)
4. Productized service ($497 for 100 leads + reports)

**Is this the right approach?** Or should I:
- Build in public and share progress?
- Offer free tier to get users first?
- Go straight to paid and see if anyone converts?
- Focus on one ICP instead of multiple angles?

**What I'm afraid of:**
- Sharing too much and getting copied
- Not sharing enough and getting no feedback
- Building features nobody wants
- Pricing too high/low

Looking for advice from people who've actually launched B2B SaaS products. What worked for you?

**Rules Compliance Note:**
- No links to landing page (against r/SaaS self-promo rules)
- Can share in DMs if people ask
- Focus on asking for strategic advice, not promotion

## 4. r/freelance - "Automating client prospecting"

**Title:** How I'm trying to automate the worst part of freelancing (finding clients)

**Post:**

**The Part I Hate Most:**

I love design work. I hate prospecting.

Specifically:
- Cold emailing feels slimy
- Generic templates get ignored
- Good personalized emails take 20 minutes each
- I don't know who actually needs help

**What I Built (for myself, then realized others might want it):**

A tool that:

1. **Finds prospects automatically** - "Find 100 restaurants in [city] with outdated websites"
2. **Analyzes each website** - AI rates design, SEO, mobile UX (gives letter grade A-F)
3. **Creates professional reports** - 20-page PDF showing issues + screenshots
4. **Writes personalized emails** - Based on actual problems found on their site

**Real example:**

- Found: "Joe's Pizza, Philadelphia" (website grade: D)
- Top issues: Mobile menu broken, no online ordering, slow load time
- Email written: "Hey Joe, I was craving pizza and found your site - noticed your mobile menu isn't working on iPhone. I bet that's costing you orders..."
- Report attached: Professional audit showing exactly what's broken

**Why I'm posting this:**

I'm trying to figure out if this is useful to other freelancers or if it's just me being lazy.

**Questions:**
1. Do you struggle with prospecting, or is it just me?
2. Would you use something like this, or does it feel too "salesy"?
3. What would make this actually worth using vs. doing it manually?

Not selling anything - genuinely trying to validate if I should turn this into a product or just keep it for myself.

**Comment Engagement:**
- If someone asks for a sample: "I can DM you a report I generated for a test restaurant - shows the quality level"
- If someone asks about cost: "Still figuring out pricing - what would you pay if it saved you 10 hours/week?"

## 5. r/marketing - "AI-powered lead magnet strategy"

**Title:** Built an AI tool that generates website audits as lead magnets - is this smart or spam?

**Post:**

**The Strategy:**

I'm testing a lead gen approach where I:

1. Find small businesses with poor websites (using AI to score them)
2. Generate a professional website audit report (automated)
3. Send it to them for free as a "hey, noticed this" outreach
4. Offer to fix the issues (that's where I get paid)

**The Tech:**

Built a platform that:
- Crawls websites and takes screenshots
- Uses GPT-4 Vision to analyze design quality
- Checks SEO, content, mobile responsiveness
- Generates 20-page PDF reports with specific recommendations
- Costs me about $0.05 per report in API fees

**Example Report Includes:**
- Letter grade (A-F)
- Top 5 issues hurting their business
- "Quick wins" they could fix today
- Before/after mockups (if I'm pitching them)
- ROI projections

**My Question:**

Is this:
- ✅ Smart lead magnet strategy (providing value upfront)?
- ❌ Borderline spam (unsolicited critiques)?
- ❓ Depends on execution?

**What I'm Worried About:**
- Coming across as "negging" (insulting their site to get business)
- Getting ignored because they didn't ask for it
- Accidentally emailing someone whose nephew "knows computers"

**What I'm Testing:**
- Email subject: "Quick audit of [their-site].com" vs "Noticed an issue on your website"
- Tone: Helpful consultant vs casual friendly
- CTA: Book a call vs Reply with questions

**For the marketers here:**
- Have you seen this approach work?
- How do you make cold outreach valuable instead of annoying?
- What would make you actually open an email like this?

Looking for real talk - not validation, but actual strategy advice.

**If someone says "This exists already":**
"Oh interesting - what are you using? I built this because I couldn't find exactly what I needed, but I'd love to check out alternatives."

**If someone asks for access:**
"DMing you - I can run a test for you. What industry are you targeting?"

**If someone criticizes the idea:**
"Appreciate the honesty - can you elaborate on why you think it wouldn't work? Trying to avoid building something useless."

**If someone asks technical questions:**
"Happy to nerd out on the tech - [brief answer]. Are you building something similar?"

## What to Share vs. Protect

### ✅ SAFE TO SHARE:
- Sample reports (PDF/screenshots)
- High-level architecture (microservices, AI models used)
- Pricing you're considering
- Problems you're trying to solve
- Results from tests ("10% response rate on cold emails")

### ⚠️ SHARE CAREFULLY:
- Exact prompts used for AI
- Database schemas
- API integrations (mention providers, not credentials)
- Specific algorithms

### ❌ NEVER SHARE:
- Source code
- API keys
- Customer data
- Proprietary AI prompt engineering
- Competitive advantages you've discovered

## Posting Schedule

**Don't post all at once** - space them out:

- **Day 1:** r/web_design (Friday afternoon - high traffic)
- **Day 3:** r/freelance (Monday morning - start of work week)
- **Day 5:** r/entrepreneur (Wednesday - mid-week engagement)
- **Day 7:** r/SaaS (Saturday - SaaS builders browsing)
- **Day 10:** r/marketing (Tuesday - marketing professionals active)

**Why space them out?**
- Gives you time to incorporate feedback
- Avoids looking spammy
- Different communities respond at different rates
- You can A/B test messaging

## Legal/Ethical Considerations

1. **Be transparent:** If people ask if you built this, say yes
2. **Respect privacy:** Don't share client reports without permission
3. **Follow subreddit rules:** Read each sub's self-promotion policy
4. **Don't manipulate:** No fake accounts, vote brigading, etc.
5. **Provide value:** Focus on helping the community, not just promoting

**Disclosure Template:**
"Full disclosure: I built this tool and I'm trying to figure out if it's useful. Not selling anything yet - just validating the idea."
