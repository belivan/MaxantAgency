## Reddit Post Template

**Title**: *Built an AI that grades websites A-F using GPT-5 Vision + 6 specialized analyzers. Roast my side project?*

**Body**:
```
Hey everyone,

Built a tool that analyzes websites using 6 AI specialists and outputs an A-F grade + actionable improvements.

What it does:
• Takes any URL → analyzes in ~3 minutes
• 6 AI analyzers: Design, SEO, Content, Social, Accessibility
• A-F grade + top 5 critical issues
• Client-ready PDF reports with screenshots
• Industry benchmarking

Tech: Next.js 14, Playwright, GPT-5, Claude 4.5, Grok-4, Supabase, Redis

[Screenshots: 3-5 images showing dashboard, reports, analysis]
[Demo video: 60-90 seconds]

Automated my agency's audits (was 4-6 hours manual, now 3.5 min + $0.10).

Questions:
1. Is A-F grading helpful or gimmicky?
2. Would you use this? What would you pay?
3. Open-source or SaaS?

Free access for anyone who wants to test their site!

## Target Subreddits (Priority Order)

1. **r/SideProject** - Best fit, post Tue/Wed 9-11am EST
2. **r/webdev** - Technical audience, emphasize architecture
3. **r/Entrepreneur** - Focus on "4-6 hours → 3.5 minutes"
4. **r/freelance** - Position as billable deliverable generator
5. **r/web_design** - They'll scrutinize quality, share sample critiques

---

## Assets to Prepare

**Before posting:**

1. **Demo Video (60-90s)**: Full analysis walkthrough, upload to YouTube/Loom
2. **Screenshots (3-5)**:
   - Dashboard with A-F grades
   - Sample PDF report page
   - Analysis in progress
3. **Sample Report**: Analyze a well-known site, host PDF on Google Drive
4. **FAQ Doc**: Cost breakdown, how grading works, roadmap

---

## Expected Questions & Answers

**"How accurate is the grading?"**
→ "Uses 6 specialized AI models + benchmarks against industry standards. 500+ analyses correlated with expert audits. Free to analyze your site!"

**"What's the cost?"**
→ "~$0.10/analysis (AI APIs). Stack costs ~$30/month. Scales well with microservices."

**"Why not Lighthouse/GTmetrix?"**
→ "Those give technical metrics. This gives business-focused advice in plain English for client reports."

**"How do you make money?"**
→ "Still exploring: SaaS for agencies, white-label, open-source + premium, or use for my agency. Open to ideas!"

**"Can I try it?"**
→ "Yes! DM your URL, I'll send full analysis + report for feedback."

## Alternative Angles

If website analyzer angle doesn't work:

- **Plan B**: "Report Generator" → target r/freelance (billable deliverables)
- **Plan C**: "Microservices Showcase" → target r/node (architecture)
- **Plan D**: "AI Agent Orchestration" → target r/artificial (17+ agents)

---

## Success Metrics

**Good feedback:**
- 50+ upvotes in first 24h
- 20+ genuine comments (not just "cool project")
- 5+ DMs requesting access
- 2-3 deep technical discussions

**What to learn:**
- Do people want this? (product-market fit)
- What would they pay? (pricing)
- Which features resonate? (roadmap)
- Who's the customer? (positioning)

---

## Dos and Don'ts

✅ **Do:**
- Present as "I built this, thoughts?"
- Offer free analyses to commenters
- Thank critics, ask follow-ups
- Be honest about limitations

❌ **Don't:**
- Sound sales-y or pitch-y
- Oversell the AI ("revolutionary")
- Respond defensively
- Share entire business plan

## Next Steps

1. Record 60s demo video
2. Take 5 screenshots
3. Export 1 sample report PDF
4. Create FAQ Google Doc
5. Post to r/SideProject (Tue/Wed 9-11am)
6. Respond to every comment within 2 hours
7. Track upvotes, comments, DMs
8. Iterate based on feedback

## Bottom Line

You have a production-ready, polished product worth $0.10/analysis that saves 4-6 hours. The microservices architecture is enterprise-grade, the UI is professional, and the AI integration is sophisticated.

**This is demo-worthy.** Post with confidence, offer free access, gather feedback, then decide: SaaS, open-source, or agency tool.
