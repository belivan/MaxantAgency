## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Analysis Paralysis
**Mistake:** Reading all the templates, never executing
**Fix:** Start with ONE experiment this week (Reddit post)

### 2. Perfectionism
**Mistake:** Waiting for platform to be "ready" before validating
**Fix:** Validate with what you have today

### 3. Building in Isolation
**Mistake:** Not talking to potential customers for months
**Fix:** 10 customer conversations before writing more code

### 4. Giving Away the Secret Sauce
**Mistake:** Sharing exact prompts/algorithms publicly
**Fix:** Read [ip-protection-guide.md](ip-protection-guide.md) first

### 5. Ignoring Negative Feedback
**Mistake:** Only listening to people who love it
**Fix:** Seek out critical feedback, adjust accordingly

### 6. Spreading Too Thin
**Mistake:** Trying all 10 experiments at once
**Fix:** Start with 3, then expand

### 7. No Clear Metrics
**Mistake:** "Getting feedback" with no success criteria
**Fix:** Define success before each experiment

---

## When to Pivot

**Signals to Pivot:**
- 5+ people say "this already exists and is better"
- 0 people willing to pay after 50+ conversations
- Consistent objection you can't address ("I'd never trust AI for this")
- Better idea emerges from customer conversations
- Regulatory/legal blocker you didn't anticipate

**How to Pivot:**
1. Analyze feedback (what did people want instead?)
2. Identify new angle (different positioning? different market? different features?)
3. Test new angle with 10 people before building
4. If validated, adjust platform; if not, consider stopping

---

## When to Scale

**Signals to Scale:**
- 50%+ of pilots convert to paid
- 10%+ monthly growth sustained for 3 months
- 75%+ retention rate
- Clear differentiation from competitors
- Customers referring other customers
- You can't keep up with demand

**How to Scale:**
1. Hire first SDR (outbound sales)
2. Invest in content marketing (SEO)
3. Launch affiliate program
4. Raise funding (if needed)
5. Build out feature requests
