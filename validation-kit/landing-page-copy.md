### Problem Section

**Headline:**
Is Manual Prospecting Killing Your Revenue?

**⏰ Time-Consuming**
Creating custom website audits takes 4-6 hours each. You can maybe do 2-3 per week. That's only 12/month.

**📉 Inconsistent Pipeline**
When you're busy with client work, prospecting stops. When projects end, your pipeline is empty.

**💸 Expensive to Scale**
Hiring an SDR costs $50K-70K/year and takes 3-6 months to ramp. Paid ads are competitive and costly.

---

### Problem Section

**Headline:**
Your Sales Team Shouldn't Spend 60% of Their Time Prospecting

**3 Pain Points:**

**🕐 Time Waste**
Your $100K reps are researching companies instead of selling. That's a $60K/year opportunity cost per rep.

**📉 Inconsistent Outreach**
Manual prospecting means some weeks you send 50 emails, other weeks zero. Inconsistent input = inconsistent output.

**💸 Expensive SDRs**
Hiring SDRs costs $50K-70K each, they take 6 months to ramp, and 50% churn in Year 1.

---

### Solution Section

Before/after showing generic ebook (2% conversion) vs. personalized audit (18% conversion)

---

### Problem Section

**Headline:**
Your Current Lead Magnets Aren't Working

**Generic Ebooks: 2-5% conversion**
Everyone offers ebooks. Nobody reads them. They go straight to the "downloads" folder and get forgotten.

**Webinars: Huge time investment**
You spend hours creating content, promoting it, hosting it. Maybe 10 people show up. 2 become leads.

**Free Consultations: Not scalable**
1-hour calls with unqualified tire-kickers. You can only do 3-5 per week before burning out.

---

### Solution Section

**Headline:**
The Lead Magnet That Actually Converts

**Instant Gratification**
Visitor submits their URL. AI analyzes in 60 seconds. They download report immediately. No waiting.

**Demonstrates Expertise**
Shows you know your stuff. Builds trust. Makes the sale easier.

$0.05 per audit. Compare to $50-200 per webinar attendee or paid ad click.

---
