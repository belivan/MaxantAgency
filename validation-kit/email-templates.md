## Template Category 1: Agency Partnership Outreach

### EMAIL 1A: Partnership Pilot Invitation

**Use Case:** Recruiting agencies for free pilot program

**Subject Line Options:**
- Partnership pilot - [Your Agency Name]
- Testing new lead gen platform - interested?
- Free pilot for [number] agencies

**Email Body:**

```
Hey [First Name],

I've been following [Agency Name] on [LinkedIn/Instagram] and noticed you focus on [their niche].

I built an AI platform that automates prospecting and website audits for agencies like yours. Here's what it does:

• Finds 100+ qualified prospects/week in your target market
• Analyzes their websites in 60 seconds (design, SEO, mobile, content)
• Generates professional audit reports you can send to prospects
• Composes personalized outreach emails

I'm looking for 10 agencies to pilot it for free (30 days) in exchange for honest feedback.

If you're spending 10+ hours/week on prospecting, this might save you a ton of time.

Interested in testing it? I can get you set up this week.

[Your name]

P.S. - Here's a sample report I generated for a [industry] company: [link]
```

**Why This Works:**
- Personalized opening (shows you researched them)
- Clear value proposition
- Low-commitment ask (free pilot)
- Social proof (you're selective - only 10 agencies)
- Specific timeframe (30 days)
- P.S. provides proof (sample report)

---

### EMAIL 1B: Follow-Up (3 days later, if no response)

**Subject:** Re: Partnership pilot - [Your Agency Name]

**Email Body:**

```
Hey [First Name],

Wanted to make sure you saw my email about the pilot program.

Quick question: Are you currently spending time on manual prospecting, or have you already automated that part of your workflow?

If it's manual, I'd love to show you what we built. If it's automated, I'm curious what you're using (always looking to learn from other agencies).

Either way, let me know.

[Your name]
```

**Why This Works:**
- References previous email (context)
- Asks a question (encourages reply)
- Shows genuine curiosity (not just selling)
- Short and to the point

---

### EMAIL 1C: Follow-Up #2 (7 days later)

**Subject:** Last try - pilot program

**Email Body:**

```
[First Name],

I know you're busy, so I'll make this quick.

I'm wrapping up pilot recruitment this week. Have 7 agencies confirmed, room for 3 more.

If you want in, reply "YES" and I'll send details.

If not interested, reply "NO" and I'll stop bugging you.

Either way, appreciate your time.

[Your name]
```

**Why This Works:**
- Acknowledges they're busy (respect)
- Creates urgency (closing soon)
- Social proof (7 already confirmed)
- Easy response ("YES" or "NO")
- Respects their inbox

## Template Category 2: Value-First Outreach (Free Audit)

### EMAIL 2A: Free Audit Offer

**Use Case:** Offering free website audit to demonstrate value

**Subject Line Options:**
- Quick audit of [their-domain].com
- Noticed [specific issue] on your site
- Made you a free website audit

**Email Body:**

```
Hey [First Name],

I was researching [industry] agencies in [city] and found [Agency Name].

Took a quick look at [their-domain].com and ran it through our AI analysis tool.

Found a few things that might be worth fixing:

• [Specific issue #1 - e.g., "Mobile menu isn't working on iPhone"]
• [Specific issue #2 - e.g., "Missing meta descriptions on 12 pages"]
• [Specific issue #3 - e.g., "CTA buttons lack prominence - probably hurting conversions"]

Made you a full audit report (20 pages) with screenshots and recommendations. Figured you'd want to see it.

Attached. No strings attached - just thought you'd find it useful.

[Your name]

P.S. - If any of the recommendations don't make sense, happy to jump on a quick call to explain.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Genuine reason for contact (research)
- Specific issues (proves you looked)
- Provides immediate value (free audit)
- No ask (builds reciprocity)
- Optional next step (call if they want)

---

### EMAIL 2B: Follow-Up (5 days later)

**Subject:** Re: Quick audit of [their-domain].com

**Email Body:**

```
[First Name],

Wanted to make sure you got the audit I sent last week.

I ran your site through our analyzer and found a few quick wins that could probably be fixed in under 2 hours:

1. [Quick win #1]
2. [Quick win #2]
3. [Quick win #3]

Let me know if you have questions about any of the recommendations. Happy to walk through it on a quick call if helpful.

[Your name]
```

---

### EMAIL 2C: Soft Pitch (10 days later, if they engaged)

**Subject:** Following up

**Email Body:**

```
[First Name],

Glad the audit was helpful!

Quick question: Are you planning to tackle any of those fixes in-house, or would it make sense to chat about us helping?

We've helped [similar agency/company] implement similar recommendations and they saw [specific result - e.g., "23% increase in contact form submissions"].

No pressure either way - just wanted to offer if it's useful.

Let me know.

[Your name]
```

## Template Category 3: Direct Sales Pitch

### EMAIL 3A: Problem-Focused Pitch

**Use Case:** Cold outreach with clear pain point

**Subject Line Options:**
- Is prospecting eating up your time?
- Question about [Agency Name]'s lead gen
- How do you currently find new clients?

**Email Body:**

```
[First Name],

Quick question: How much time does [Agency Name] spend each week on prospecting?

I'm asking because I built a platform that automates the parts most agencies hate:

• Finding qualified prospects (AI scores websites, filters out bad fits)
• Creating custom audit reports (60 seconds instead of 6 hours)
• Writing personalized outreach (based on what the AI found)

Agencies using it are booking 2-3 new clients per month without spending 10-15 hours/week on manual work.

Would it make sense to do a quick 15-min demo to see if this fits your workflow?

[Your name]

P.S. - If timing isn't right, no worries. Just let me know and I won't follow up.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Opens with a question (engages curiosity)
- Addresses specific pain (time spent prospecting)
- Quantifies benefit (2-3 clients/month)
- Low-commitment ask (15-min demo)
- Respects their time (opt-out offer)

---

### EMAIL 3B: Results-Focused Pitch

**Subject:** How [Agency Name] is booking 47 calls/month

**Email Body:**

```
[First Name],

We help agencies like [their agency] generate consistent leads without hiring SDRs.

Here's what one agency (similar size to yours) did last month:

• Found 143 qualified prospects in their target market
• Generated 143 personalized website audit reports
• Sent 143 value-first emails (attached the free audits)
• Got 24 responses (17% response rate)
• Booked 16 sales calls

Total cost: $17 in AI fees
Total time: About 2 hours (mostly reviewing reports)

Their previous approach: Generic cold emails with 0.5% response rate.

Want to see how they did it? I can walk you through the system in 15 minutes.

[Your name]
```

**Why This Works:**
- Case study format (credible)
- Specific numbers (not vague claims)
- Shows ROI (cost vs. results)
- Creates curiosity (how did they do it?)

## Template Category 4: Productized Service Sale

### EMAIL 4A: "100 Leads Package" Pitch

**Use Case:** Selling done-for-you lead generation service

**Subject Line Options:**
- 100 qualified leads in 5 days
- Done-for-you lead generation
- [Agency Name] + lead gen

**Email Body:**

```
[First Name],

What if you had 100 qualified prospects, fully researched, with personalized outreach ready to send?

That's what we do.

**Here's how it works:**

You tell us your ideal customer:
• Industry (e.g., "restaurants in major metros")
• Size (e.g., "$500K-2M revenue")
• Pain points (e.g., "outdated websites")

We deliver:

### EMAIL 4B: Follow-Up (3 days later)

**Subject:** Re: 100 qualified leads in 5 days

**Email Body:**

```
[First Name],

Wanted to follow up on the 100 leads package I mentioned.

Here's a sample of what you'd receive:

• Prospect list (Google Sheet): [link to sample]
• Sample audit report (PDF): [link]
• Sample outreach email: [link]

This is the actual quality you'd get. All you do is review and send.

Most agencies close 1-2 clients from 100 outreach emails (if they're qualified). At your average project size, that's [calculate ROI] from a $497 investment.

Want to give it a shot? Reply and I'll get started this week.

[Your name]

## Template Category 5: White-Label Partnership

### EMAIL 5A: White-Label Partner Pitch

**Use Case:** Pitching white-label platform to larger agencies

**Subject Line Options:**
- Partnership opportunity - [Your Agency]
- White-label lead gen platform
- Add $500K ARR without hiring engineers

**Email Body:**

```
[First Name],

I run a lead generation platform used by 50+ agencies. A few of them asked if they could white-label it for their clients.

So we built that.

**Here's the opportunity:**

We provide:
• Full platform (prospecting, analysis, reporting, outreach)
• Your branding (logo, colors, domain)
• Client portals (multi-tenant)
• Ongoing updates and maintenance

You provide:
• Sales (to your existing clients or new ones)
• Client onboarding
• Strategy (we can help or you handle it)

**Economics:**
• You pay us $200/client/month
• You charge your clients $500-2,000/month
• You keep the difference (70-90% margins)

Example: 20 clients at $750/month = $11,000 profit/month for you.

This could be a $500K+ ARR opportunity if you have the client base.

Want to explore? Happy to walk through the partner program.

[Your name]
```

---

### EMAIL 5B: Follow-Up

**Subject:** Re: Partnership opportunity

**Email Body:**

```
[First Name],

Following up on the white-label partnership I mentioned.

Quick question: Do your clients ever ask about lead generation or prospecting tools?

If so, this might be a natural upsell for you. If not, it could be a way to win new clients (by offering something competitors don't).

Either way, I'd be happy to show you what it looks like white-labeled. Takes about 20 minutes.

Let me know if you want to see it.

[Your name]
```

## Template Category 6: Validation/Feedback Requests

### EMAIL 6A: Feedback Request (Non-Sales)

**Use Case:** Getting honest feedback without asking for a sale

**Subject Line:** Quick favor - need your opinion

**Email Body:**

```
[First Name],

I'm working on a new platform for agencies and I need honest feedback from people who actually do this work.

Here's what I built: [1-2 sentence description]

I'm trying to figure out:
1. Is this actually useful or am I solving a problem that doesn't exist?
2. What would make it worth paying for (if anything)?
3. What am I missing that would make this a no-brainer?

Would you be willing to look at a demo (15 min) and give me your brutally honest opinion?

Not trying to sell you anything - genuinely just need feedback from someone who knows the space.

Let me know. Happy to return the favor if you're ever building something.

[Your name]
```
