**Email Body:**

Hi [First Name],

My name is [Your Name], and I run Maksant, a web design studio based in Swarthmore. We specialize in building high-quality websites for local businesses throughout the Greater Philadelphia area.

I came across [Company Name] and was impressed by [specific genuine compliment about their business, service, or local presence]. As a fellow business owner in the area, I know how important it is to have a website that truly represents the quality of work you do.

**What makes us different:**

We're not a big agency or a freelancer working from their laptop at a coffee shop. We're a dedicated studio that's built websites for [healthcare providers, transportation services, retail businesses, and lifestyle brands] right here in the region — companies like Arsenal Transportation, Bright Start Therapy, and LQRS.

**Our approach is simple:**
- **Fast delivery** — 5 to 31 days from start to finish
- **Fixed scope** — you know exactly what you're getting and what it costs
- **Weekly updates** — no disappearing for weeks at a time
- **You own everything** — domain, hosting, all of it. No lock-in.
- **Local support** — we're here when you need us, even after launch

I'd love to learn more about [Company Name] and see if we'd be a good fit to help elevate your online presence. Would you be open to meeting for coffee in [their area/Swarthmore/Center City] or a quick call this week?

Looking forward to connecting,

[Your Name]

**Follow-up Email (if no response after 4-5 days):**

Hi [First Name],

I know running a business keeps you busy — just wanted to follow up on my note from earlier this week.

We've worked with quite a few [industry] businesses in the area, and I've seen firsthand how the right website can make a real difference in attracting the right customers.

If you'd ever like to chat about how we could help [Company Name] stand out online, I'm just a quick drive away. Even if it's not the right time now, I'd be happy to grab coffee and talk shop.

Best,
[Your Name]
Maksant

**Alternative: More Personal/Story-Driven Version**

Hi [First Name],

I'm [Your Name], founder of Maksant, a web design studio in Swarthmore serving businesses across Greater Philadelphia.

I started Maksant because I saw too many local businesses getting stuck with cookie-cutter websites, flaky freelancers, or agencies that overpromise and underdeliver. As someone who's built [business type] websites for companies like [relevant local example from portfolio], I know what it takes to create something that actually drives results.

I came across [Company Name] and thought we might be a great fit. Here's why:

**You get a partner, not just a vendor:**
- We meet in person (coffee's on me)
- Fixed timelines and scope — no surprises
- Weekly progress updates
- Post-launch support when you need it
- You own your domain and hosting from day one

**Our work speaks for itself:**
Take a look at [specific relevant portfolio piece] — we helped them [specific result or transformation]. We can do the same for [Company Name].

Would you be open to a conversation? I'm happy to drive to [their location] or meet somewhere convenient for you.

Looking forward to it,

[Your Name]

P.S. — Even if you're not ready right now, I'd genuinely enjoy connecting with another local business owner. Let me know if you'd like to grab coffee sometime.
