Excellent! I've completed my research on what makes an effective website audit report according to industry experts and recent 2025 sources. Let me summarize what I found:

What Sets Expert Audits Apart:

Template frameworks that track trends over time with automated benchmarks
Client customization based on industry KPIs and project scope
Actionable recommendations vs. just problem identification
Visual evidence (screenshots, heatmaps, analytics dashboards)
ROI projections tied to recommended fixes
Note: While I found extensive content from established experts (Backlinko, CXL/Speero, etc.), there wasn't much high-quality content specifically from Substack in October 2025 on this topic. The most relevant Substack content was the E-commerce Innovators Digest, which discussed imagery optimization and technical SEO using tools like Screaming Frog and SEMrush, but it wasn't from a particularly famous individual author. The most actionable and recent framework came from PixelCrayons' October 2025 article, which provided a clear 4-category structure with 19 specific audit elements and a task-priority grid for client presentation. Would you like me to use any of these frameworks to improve the MaxantAgency website audit reports, or were you just doing research?
