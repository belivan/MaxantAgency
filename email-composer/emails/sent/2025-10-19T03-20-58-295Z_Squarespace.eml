Anthony,

Your homepage loads fast and the free trial callout is smart—that removes friction for creators testing the platform.

One thing: the main headline "A website makes it real" doesn't tell comparison-shoppers why to choose Squarespace over competitors. Since 53% of visitors bounce from slow sites, you're already winning on speed—but that headline could instantly communicate your AI tools + commerce edge. Testing a benefit-focused headline ("Build and sell in minutes" or similar) could lift signups noticeably.

Also, I didn't spot pricing or a plan comparison link on the homepage. Price-sensitive agencies and small businesses often leave to compare—surfacing a "See plans" button could keep them on-site longer.

Worth a quick chat? I'd love to show you how two small tweaks could move the needle on conversions.
