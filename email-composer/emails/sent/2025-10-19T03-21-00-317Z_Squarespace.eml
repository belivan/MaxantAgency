Anthony,

Squarespace's homepage loads fast and showcases your product breadth really well—that's a solid foundation.

TESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSTTT

One quick opportunity: your main headline "A website makes it real" is memorable but doesn't tell comparison-shoppers *why* to choose Squarespace over competitors. Meanwhile, visitors looking for pricing or plan details have to hunt for it, and there's no direct contact info for enterprise buyers who prefer to talk first.

Testing a benefit-focused headline (ease + AI + commerce) and surfacing starting prices could help convert more of the traffic you're already getting.

Worth a 15-minute call to walk through what we're seeing?
