Anthony,

Your homepage loads fast and the free trial messaging is clear—great foundation.

One thing: your main headline "A website makes it real" doesn't tell comparison-shoppers why to choose Squarespace over competitors. Since 53% of visitors leave slow or unclear sites within seconds, testing a benefit-focused headline (like calling out your AI tools + ease of use) could immediately boost trial signups.

Also noticed pricing isn't visible on the homepage—adding a "See plans" link would help agencies and small businesses evaluate faster without bouncing to compare alternatives.

Worth a quick 15-minute call to walk through 2-3 tweaks that could move the needle on conversions?
