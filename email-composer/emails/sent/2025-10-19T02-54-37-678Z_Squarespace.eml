Anthony,

I was looking at squarespace.com and noticed the main headline "A website makes it real" doesn't tell visitors *why* to choose Squarespace over competitors – especially those comparing platforms side-by-side.

For a company in the crowded website builder space, that ambiguity could be costing you conversions from creators and small businesses who need to understand your unique value in 3 seconds.

I also noticed there's no pricing preview or "See plans" link on the homepage, which means price-conscious visitors are likely bouncing to compare alternatives.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to walk through a few specific tweaks that could help more visitors convert?
