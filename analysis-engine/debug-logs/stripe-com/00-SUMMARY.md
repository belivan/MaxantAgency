## FILES GENERATED

All debug files are located in: `./debug-logs/stripe-com/`

1. Discovery data
2. Page selection (prompt + response + result)
3. Crawl results
4. Each analyzer (prompt + response + parsed data)
5. Grading calculation
6. Final aggregated result

## HOW TO USE THIS DATA

### Review AI Prompts
Look at `*-prompt.txt` files to see exactly what was sent to each AI model.

### Check AI Responses
Look at `*-response.json` files to see raw responses from AI before parsing.

### Verify Parsing
Compare `*-response.json` with `*-parsed.json` to ensure parsing worked correctly.

### Debug Issues
If something looks wrong, trace through the files in order to find where the problem occurred.

### Tune Prompts
Use the raw data to refine your prompts in `config/prompts/` if needed.
