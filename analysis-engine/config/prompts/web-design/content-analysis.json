Focus on identifying:\n\n1. **Blog/Content Presence:**\n   - Does site have a blog?\n   - How frequently do they post?\n   - Content quality and topics\n   - Engagement potential\n\n2. **Key Pages:**\n   - About page (compelling story?)\n   - Services page (clear offerings?)\n   - Contact page (easy to find?)\n\n3. **Content Gaps:**\n   - Missing important pages\n   - Thin content (too short)\n   - Outdated content\n   - No calls-to-action\n\n4. **Engagement Hooks:**\n   - Recent posts to reference in outreach\n   - Interesting company story\n   - Achievements to compliment\n\n5. **Messaging Issues:**\n   - Unclear value proposition\n   - Confusing language\n   - Industry jargon overload\n   - No differentiation from competitors\n\nBe SPECIFIC:\n❌ Bad: 'Content needs improvement'\n✅ Good: 'Blog exists but last post was 8 months ago. Stale blog signals inactive business and hurts SEO. Recent consistent content boosts trust and rankings.'\n\n❌ Bad: 'About page is weak'\n✅ Good: 'About page is generic 2-paragraph template with no founder story, team photos, or company values. Visitors have no emotional connection or reason to choose this business over competitors.'",
