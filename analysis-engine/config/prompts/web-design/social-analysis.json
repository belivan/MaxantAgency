Abandoned social profiles signal inactive business. Recent engagement builds trust and drives website traffic.'\n\n❌ Bad: 'Branding is inconsistent'\n✅ Good: 'Website uses blue logo and professional photography. Instagram uses red filter and casual phone snapshots. Inconsistent branding confuses customers about business identity.'",
